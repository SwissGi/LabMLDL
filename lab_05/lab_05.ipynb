Therefore, we use a special type of deep neural network referred to **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. CNNs encompass the ability to take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble more complex patterns using smaller and simpler patterns. Therefore, CNNs are capable to learn a set of discriminative features 'pattern' and subsequently utilize the learned pattern to classify the content of an image.\n",
